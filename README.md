# IsCatInHere
A quick ramble. I have been interested in deploying a model in AWS for a while, and here it is finally :). This isn't gonna be a tutorial sadly because it's really a combo of things I learned (and I am too tired to type it), but here is a beautiful blog post by [Vinicyus Brasil](https://vinybrasil.github.io/blog/classification-model/). Other resources include [this](https://youtu.be/qcIrjLh0ELo?si=ZQh2ORZrYaZtpYqT) tutorial on YouTube by Cloud Guru and [this](https://youtu.be/RGIM4JfsSk0?si=PafE0yyBqJfR5Ftj) one by pixegami. 
Both are also wonderful videos. 

The docker build file and the app are in ``catseg/predict/catapi ``, with a Python call to the model hosted in the dir before and the training in the dir before that. 

Anyway it's been fun, till next time :)
